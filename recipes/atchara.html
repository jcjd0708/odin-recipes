            This pickled red cabbage is a Filipino recipe that uses a cold-flash-pickling method. 
            Sour flavors are important in Filipino cooking, and quick pickles like this both heighten the sourness and serve as 
            palate-cleansers, balancing and cutting through fattier dishes. Store in the refrigerate for up to 3 days.
