    <p>
        You can make this super-delicious Filipino coconut garlic fried rice (sinangag) recipe mostly ahead of time 
        because you need the steamed rice to cool and dry out a bit before you fry it. 
        The final result is irresistible and goes with everything on this menu, so I like to make two batches 
        — one plain and one with the optional turmeric — which adds a little extra flavor and a pretty orange color.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>½ (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    </ul>

                Place rice in a large bowl with enough water to cover by a few inches; swirl with your fingers, then drain. 
                Repeat until water runs clear, about 3 times.
            </p>

                Combine rice, 1 ½ cups water, coconut cream, turmeric, and salt in a saucepan; 
                bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 
                about 20 minutes. Chill, uncovered, 2 to 4 hours to overnight.

                Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.
